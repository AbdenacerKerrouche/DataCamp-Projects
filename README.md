This repository contains projects I have completed on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) to practice and apply my data science skills. It demonstrates hands-on experience with Python, R, and data analysis techniques through real-world datasets.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Investigating Netflix Movies** | Perform exploratory data analysis on Netflix movie data to uncover insights about movies from a particular decade for a production company. | Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Data Visualization |
| **Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores** | Analyze standardized test performance data across New York City public schools to identify top-performing schools, variations by borough, and city-wide trends. | Python, Pandas, Data Manipulation, Summary Statistics |

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data manipulation and cleaning with Pandas  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Summary statistics and insights extraction from real datasets  
- Problem-solving with practical datasets
